We provide here a Jax JIT-able implementation of the [knapskack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

The knapsack problem is a famous problem in combinatorial optimization. The goal is to determine, given
a set of items, each with a weight and a value,
which items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal
to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

The decision problem form of the knapsack problem is NP-complete, thus there is no known
algorithm both correct and fast (polynomial-time) in all cases.

When the environment is reset, a new problem instance is generated, by sampling weights and values
from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The weight limit of the knapsack is a parameter of the
environment.
A trajectory terminates when no further item can be added to the knapsack, or the last action
is invalid.

## Observation
The observation given to the agent provides information regarding the weights and the values of all the items,
as well as, which items have been packed into the knapsack.

**Observation Spec**:

- `weights` jax array (float32) of shape `(num_items,)`, shows an array of weights of the items to be packed into the knapsack.
- `values` jax array (float32) of shape `(num_items,)`, shows an array of values of the items to be packed into the knapsack.
- `action_mask`: jax array (bool) of shape `(num_items,)`, array of binary values denoting which items can be packed into the knapsack.

## Action
Action space is a `DiscreteArray` of integer values in the range of [0, num_items-1]. An action is the index of the
item to pack next.

```
action: 2  # Problem consisting of 4 items, choosing item 2 (among items 0, 1, 2, 3).
```

## Reward

The reward is 0 at every step, except at the last timestep when the reward is the
total value of the knapsack.
