We provide here an implementation of the 3D [bin packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem).

The goal of the agent is to efficiently pack a set of boxes of different sizes into a single container with
as little empty space as possible by the end of the episode.

## Observation
The observation given to the agent provides information on the available empty space, the items that
are still to be packed and information on what actions are legal at this point. The full observation
spec is as follows:

```
Observation:
    ems: EMS(Empty Maximal Space) specifying space that can contain an Item # defined by 3d points (x1, x2, y1, y2, z1, z2) | shape (obs_num_ems,)
    ems_mask: chex.Array  # True if ems exist | shape (obs_num_ems,)
    items: Item # defined by (x_len, y_len, z_len) | shape (max_num_items,)
    items_mask: chex.Array  # True if items exist | shape (max_num_items,)
    items_placed: chex.Array  # True if items are placed in the container | shape (max_num_items,)
    action_mask: chex.Array  # Joint action mask specifying which actions are valid | shape (obs_num_ems, max_num_items)
```

## Actions
At each step in the environment the agent needs to provide an action specifying 2 integers:
- The ID of the Item that will be placed with.
- the ID of the EMS that the Item will be placed in.

Actions taken in the BinPack environment follow rules:

- **placement**: The chosen item will be placed in the bottom left corner of the chosen space.
- **support**: an item can be placed only in an EMS. These spaces are defined to have a
non-zero support with an item below or a container surface. Since the item is placed in the corner,
the support could end up being null. Hence, the item could technically fall to the side or down
below but the environment keeps it in the corner of the EMS for sake of simplicity.
- **gravity**: There is no gravity enforced.

Note: Not all actions are allow at each time step (i.e. you can't place an item in
space that already contains an item). To avoid taking illegal actions you should always use the
`action_mask` contained in the observation.

```python
#TODO - action example
```

```
action: jax array of shape (2,) # (ems_id, item_id)
```

## Reward
At the end of the episode, the reward is calculated by penalizing the agent for any remaining space
in the container, `reward = volume_utilization - 1.0`.
i.e. if the container is 80% full at the end of the episode, the agent will receive
a reward of `-0.20`. Unless it is a terminal state, each step in the episode returns
a reward of `0.0`.

```
reward: jax array of shape() # [-1, 0]
```
